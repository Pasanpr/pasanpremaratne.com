When working with Objective-C projects in Xcode, you will occasionally
want to work with third party libraries. This can be a bit cumbersome as
Xcode doesn't have a clean solution. You can either link a static
library, which involves setting up the header paths to point to the
correct location, or you can download the source files from the library
and include it in your project. Neither of these options are great,
especially if you want to keep your libraries up to date.

[CocoaPods](http://beta.cocoapods.org/) is an Objective-C dependency
manager and offers a great solution to this problem. If you are familiar
with Ruby, this works much like a Ruby gem (I'm not familiar with Ruby
and don't have a clue what that means). It is built with Ruby and can be
installed using the default Ruby on OS X. To understand how CocoaPods
simplifies the process of including third party libraries, we're going
to create an Xcode project and add a few different libraries to it.
Let's start by installing CocoaPods:

```bash
$ sudo gem install cocoapods
```

When using the default Ruby install you have to use `sudo` when
installing a gem (what the heck is
[sudo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudo)?). If I understand correctly,
you don't have to use `sudo` when using the Ruby Version Manager or RVM,
but that's outside the scope of this post. You now have CocoaPods
installed on your system.

To search for libraries you can run:

```bash
$ pod list
```

That shows you all libraries and that probably doesn't help you very
much, since there are, at the writing of this post, 3136 pods. You can
also be more specific and search for pods. Running the following command
searches for pods with 'cup' in the name and returns a pod called
CupertinoYankee:

```bash
$ pod search cup

-> CupertinoYankee (1.0.0)
   An NSDate Category With Locale-Aware Calculations for Beginning & End of Day, Week, Month, and Year.
   pod 'CupertinoYankee', '~> 1.0.0'
   - Homepage: https://github.com/mattt/CupertinoYankee
   - Source:   https://github.com/mattt/CupertinoYankee.git
   - Versions: 1.0.0, 0.1.1, 0.1.0 [master repo]
```

Adding Libraries to Xcode Projects
----------------------------------

Let's create a simple Xcode project. Everything looks the same, we have
our basic files.

![image](https://cl.ly/1Q162t1K3m1H/sample-project-structure.png)

I want to add the following libraries to the project:
[CupertinoYankee](https://github.com/mattt/CupertinoYankee),
[GroundControl](https://github.com/mattt/GroundControl) and
[AFNetworking](https://github.com/mattt/AFNetworking). To do this, in
the main Xcode project directory, create a file called `Podfile` and add
the following code:

```ruby
platform :ios, '7.0'
pod 'CupertinoYankee', '~> 1.0.0'
pod 'GroundControl', '~> 2.0.0'
pod 'AFNetworking', '~> 2.0.3'
```

A Podfile is similar to a Gemfile. All we're doing is specifying the
platform and listing each dependency along with the version required. If
you don't know how to list the dependency, on the [CocoaPods
website](http://beta.cocoapods.org/), just start typing the name of the
library. When you find the library you are looking for, click the
clipboard icon to copy the necessary text. Then it's as easy as running:

```bash
$ pod install
```

When you run this command CocoaPods creates a workspace, adds our
current project to the workspace and adds all the pods we specified into
a Pods project which it then statically links. Once the command executes
it reminds you to use the workspace, instead of opening up our project
directly.

```bash
[!] From now on use `SampleProject.xcworkspace`.
```

If we go ahead and open up our workspace, we can see the Pods project
that was generated, along with the libraries and relevant source files.

In our project directory, you will notice a new `Pods.xcconfig` file
that specifies the relevant header search paths automatically.

So let's go ahead and use these libraries in our project. Navigate to
the `SampleViewController.m` file and add import the following headers:

```objectivec
#import "AFNetworking.h"
#import "NSDate+CupertinoYankee.h"
#import "NSUserDefaults+GroundControl.h"
```

And that's all you need to do! An easy and clean way to manage any
dependencies in your Objective-C projects.
