I have nothing against Wordpress; I just don't blog heavily enough for
it to be my platform of choice. For a few entries here and there,
logging in and going through the usual process in the admin panel was
starting to passively annoy me. Ever since I started using [iA
Writer](http://www.iawriter.com/) to write content for work, using a
WYSIWYG editor for anything is too much.

Also since I'm learning how to program, using a static blog
forces/allows me to learn certain concepts that furthers my goal. So
here I am, using [rstblog](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/rstblog). It's
fairly simple and took a short time to setup and get running. Most of
the web points to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), but I don't know a
thing about Ruby. Rstblog is all Python, something I'm a little bit
familiar with. It is also wonderfully minimal. To learn more about how
to set up rstblog, read these posts:
[1](http://mattdeboard.net/2011/05/09/more-tips-on-rstblog/) ,
[2](http://codesymphony.net/2011/09/10/setting-up-rstblog/) and
[3](http://sbhr.dk/2010/11/30/using-rstblog/).

I guess my next step would be to write a script to get all the building
and pushing to the server out of the way. Baby steps. I'll get there
eventually.

**Side-note**: I don't know yet how to bring in all the posts from my old
WP blog with their Disqus comments. At some point I'll try and archive
all that.
