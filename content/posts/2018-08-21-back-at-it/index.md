It's been almost 4 years. Clearly I'm terrible at this. The last time I published a post I didn't have any kids!

I hear the trick is to not worry about crafting the perfect post and just get something out until you're in a rhythm. Let's give that a try (watch this be the last post for the next 4 years).

I've been wanting to learn about compilers and interpreters for a while now and [Crafting Interpreters](https://www.craftinginterpreters.com) seems like a great place to start. Follow along with me!
